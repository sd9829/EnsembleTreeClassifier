In this lab, I aimed to classify sentences as either English or Dutch 
using a decision tree and AdaBoost learning algorithms. The features.py 
file contains the functions required to extract relevant features from the input sentences.

Features:
We used the following features for the classification task:

Average word length: We calculated the average length of words in a sentence and checked if it 
was greater than 5.
Presence of English articles: We checked if any English articles ("an" or "the") were present 
in the sentence.
Presence of Dutch diphthongs: We checked if any common Dutch diphthongs were present 
in the sentence.
Presence of Dutch common words: We checked if any common Dutch words were present 
in the sentence.
Presence of English common words: We checked if any common English words were present 
in the sentence.
Non-English characters: We checked if any non-alphanumeric characters were present 
in the sentence.

Decision Tree Learning:
We built a decision tree classifier using the information gain (IG) criterion to 
find the best attribute to split the dataset at each node. We set the maximum depth 
of the tree (MAX_DEPTH) to 6. This value was chosen based on experimental evaluation 
and tuning to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. After 
training the decision tree, we evaluated its performance on a test dataset and 
observed satisfactory classification accuracy.

AdaBoost:
We used the AdaBoost algorithm to create an ensemble of decision tree classifiers. 
During the boosting process, we adjusted the weights of the training examples 
based on the errors made by the current classifier, and normalized the weights 
after each iteration. We used a single-level decision tree as a weak classifier 
(ADA_NO_OF_STUMPS = 1). The number of trees in the ensemble was determined by 
the number of features in the dataset. Our testing showed that the ensemble 
classifier significantly improved the classification performance compared to a 
single decision tree.
